The following is a list of environment variables that are used to control
behaviour in the Bash tests. This list may not be complete, and as always, the
definitive source is the code.

| Variable name               | Description                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADDITIONAL_ARGS` | Additional arguments passed to `juju bootstrap`.                                   |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ARCH`            | Architecture to bootstrap on - passed to `--bootstrap-constraints`.                |
| `BOOTSTRAP_CLOUD`           | The cloud to use when bootstrapping (i.e. the first argument to `juju bootstrap`). |
| `BOOTSTRAP_PROVIDER`        | The provider to use when bootstrapping (see the `provider` package).               |
| `BOOTSTRAP_REUSE`           | Reuse an existing controller when asked to bootstrap (true/false).                 |
| `BOOTSTRAP_REUSE_LOCAL`     | The name of a local controller to reuse for testing. Set using the `-l` flag.      |
| `BOOTSTRAP_SERIES`          | Series to use for the controller. Set using the `-S` flag.                         |
| `KILL_CONTROLLER`           | If `'true'`, controllers will be forcibly killed during teardown.                  |
| `MODEL_ARCH`                | Will be set as a model constraint on newly added models.                           |
| `OPERATOR_IMAGE_ACCOUNT`    | Passed as the value of `--config caas-image-repo` when bootstrapping.              |
| `TEST_INSPECT`              | If set, pause before teardown to allow inspection of the controller.               |
